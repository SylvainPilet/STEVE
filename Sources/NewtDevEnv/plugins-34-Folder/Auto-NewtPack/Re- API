This utility is the follow-on to the his original 'soup-based run-time mechanism' called "RUNewt". NewtPack has an API that other programers can take advantage of. For more info: <http://www.netaxs.com/~weyer/newton/releases.htm>.<< >I could not locate your http://my http is http://www.netaxs.com/~weyer/newton/releases.html >Would you please send to me information on API that we can use to covert our text (soup based) database into a Newton package without NTK. is your soup-based database an autopart or application? [I haven't yet added support to NewtPack for store parts, though I don't think that should be too difficult] I haven't posted the NewtPack API for public consumption yet. Currently I distribute NewtPack only with my products (NewtDevEnv and Newt's Cape) but would like to figure out a way to offer/license/bundle it to other developers (doesn't make sense for endusers to have to register is separately). Any suggestions/offers? are you still interested? >Ed>-->TeleType Co.>311 Harvard St.>Brookline, MA 02146>tel. 617-734-9700>fax 617-734-3974>http://www.teletype.com>email: info@teletype.com
