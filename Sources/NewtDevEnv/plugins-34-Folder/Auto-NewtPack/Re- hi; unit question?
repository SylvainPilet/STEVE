The fact that the OS happens to return something, when you evaluate @8195, is (depending on your stance) an accident, a hack, a temporary and undocumented feature, or a bug. It's not a real magic pointer, and it's not a unit reference. It's sorta different, and it won't necessarily exist in future ROMs. But, it should still work with packages on current units. >when the package is saved, and I try to inspect it, the slot that contains the @8195 yields *** evt.ex.fr;type.ref.frame ***. Hmm, I'm surprised at that. I'd think that it would work if you created it in the package like that... well, perhaps the package loader is (correctly) realizing that this is an invalid MP. Have you looked at the package on the desktop (or directly by looking at the pkgref) to see if the value was changed somehow?I'd poke around in the ROM sources to find out what's going on, but that's not kosher for me anymore :-) Probably you'll have to tell the user that it's not a valid magic pointer or unit reference, and thus you can't support it reliably.Sorry...-David
