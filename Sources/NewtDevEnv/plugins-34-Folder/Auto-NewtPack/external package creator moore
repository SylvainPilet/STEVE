(Just received NTK 1.6 and am adding 2.0 support now..) I'd like to pursue creating packages with your newtPack utility. After I finish all the liscencing stuff with Apple, I might later release a version that creates its own packages, but I'm pretty sure that capability will be 2.0 only. Still, I'd like to offer my 1.3 users the ability to make packages if they purchase newtPack from you. >Let me know how you'd like to proceed.hi Rudy,I could imagine something like the following: users who wanted to save their formulas as packages could register with me for only NewtPack for $10. if they later decided to register for NewtDevEnv or for Newt's Cape, I might apply that to the price. if that sounds reasonable, tell me a little more about how you're structuring your stuff. is it an autopart that installs child templates, or an application? does it have methods that you've compiled or just slots & values. a print of a sample frame would be useful. I can then provide you with some API & context info (and maybe some cleanup hints) so that things will save properly with NewtPack.
