Thanks. hi Adam,I haven't looked into creating "soup parts" with NewtPack, though it's probably not that difficult. in might even be possible to include polygon data since you'd be on the Newton itself. If you're interested in creating your own packages (a non-trivial task) -- there are some resources available -- a "Newton formats" document from Apple (free but I'd have to dig up the address for requesting this), and an older (but still fairly accurate/complete) public description of package format still floating around (written by Matthew Faupel/Dave Fedor). another option would be to use my NewtPack plugin -- if it was just for you to create app/autoparts/soup parts, then use of that is included with registering NewtDevEnv or Newt's Cape. if you wanted your users to be able to create packages, then they'd need NewtPack (which I could license cheaply/separately to you or them individually).
