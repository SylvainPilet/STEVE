As I mention in the document, this is not for public distribution. I hope that this is clear enough on how to setup & call it, and that I haven't left out any crucial details.This is used successfully for about a year now by NewtDevEnv to save applications and autoparts, and by Newt's Cape to save books. Let me know if you have questions. If you've already verified that what you're passing as an "app" frame looks correct, I may be able to assist in some debugging NewtPack problems (though this would probably require me to have a copy of your tool, an example app you're trying to save, and a way for me to print the app frame via the Inspector before passing it to NewtPack.
